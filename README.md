Just a simple image classification with pyton and tensorflow. The datasets used is [this.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors)  

Training take about 11 minutes. And it had fairly good accuracy. Configure the model parameter will increase the accuracy.  

The model might overfitting. Since all the datasets share same characteristics; same green background. Thus, test the model with different background might give inaccurate predictions.
